# Why learn assembly?
	- Optimization 
		- Understanding the optimization capabilites of a compiler
		- complex code for simple tasks can be memory intensive due to size assembly
		code can become, since this is a direct reflection of machine code
	- Run-time behavior analysis 
		- understanding the run-time behavior of a program that is hidden 
		by the layer of abstraction that a high-level programming language provides
	- Security
		- Understanding how programs store their control information to guard 
		against malware that exploits weaknesses in system programs 

# C:
	*dest = t;
	- Store value of t at location pointed at by dest
# Assembly Code (ASM):
	movq	%rax, (%rbx)
	- Move 8 byte value to memory
	- Operands:
		- t: Register		%rax
		- dest: Register	%rbx
		- *dest: memory		M(%rbx)

# Register Conventions
- Assume function A calls function B: A is the "Caller" and B is the "Callee"
Base	Convention		Callee or Caller owned
a	return value		Callee
b	local variable		Caller
c	4th argument		Callee
d	3rd argument		Callee
si	2nd argument		Callee
di	1st argument		Callee
bp	local variable		Caller
sp	stack pointer		Caller
r8	5th argument		Callee
r9	6th argument		Callee
r10	scratch/temp		Callee
r11	scratch/temp		Callee
r12	local variable		Caller
r13	local variable		Caller	
r14	local variable		Caller
r15	local variable		Caller

Callee Owned / Caller Saved / Call Clobbered: Used for temporary quantities
Caller Owned / Callee Saved / Call Preserved: Used for values needed across all calls

# Instruction Operands:
	- With AT&T syntax, we address registers, memory, and immediate values with 
	the following syntax
		- $: used in front of immediate values
			- $15 would be the actual value 15
		- %: used in front of registers
			- %rax 
		- (): used to dereference a memory address (get the value from memory)

	- Examples:
		- $-17 is the integer -17
		- $0xC is the integer 12
		- 0x108 is just a memory address
		- %rax accesses the value stored in register rax
		- (%rax) accesses the value stored in the memory address that rax stores

	- Scaling, Shifting, and Indexing
		- Format: A(B, I, S)
		- B: base value
		- I: Index (think of this like an array)
		- S: Scalar on the index value (must be 1, 2, 4, or 8)
		- A: Shift value
		
		- Examples:
			- 9(%rax): means to access the value at the memory location in rax
				and add 9 to that value
			- (%rbx, %rdi): The base memory is located at rbx, and rdi tells us 
					the index to apply to the base location. Usage applies
					well to arrays, where indexes are more clearly defined
			- -12(%rbx, %rdi): Go to 12 addresses before where the previous example
					   would have been
			- ( ,%rdi, 4): multiply the value of rdi by 4, and go to that memory 
				       address
			- 10( ,%rdi, 4): go 10 addresses past where the previous example would 
					 have been
			- 10(%rbx, %rdi, 4): Determine the index by multiplying rdi by 4, 
					     apply this index to the base, and go 10 addresses 
					     over.
